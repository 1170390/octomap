For better integration, OctoMap's ROS integration is now moved into its own
octomap_mapping stack, available in Freiburg's ROS repository at

  http://code.google.com/p/alufr-ros-pkg/
  
The "octomap" package in that stack will provide ROS integration by checking
out the OctoMap code from SVN and building it. More information is available at:
